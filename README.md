# VR-game

Game that I created in Unity, the game starts with the player at the bottom of a ramp which the player must get to the top while avoiding objects that are coming down the ramp. The players goal is to reach the top and selected the glowing object to finish the game.
Due to the file being too big email me if you wish to see the game. The game use's C# scripts to add function to the game.
